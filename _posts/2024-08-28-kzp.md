I've always been fascinated by puzzles such as **sudoku** and **hashi** (bridges). Sometimes, you get a really beautiful chain of deductions leading to an unexpected 'a-ha!' moment. Those moments, in my opinion, are the reason to solve puzzles in the first place. 

For quite a while, I'd been trying to create my own entry into the genre, but somehow this puzzle came to me completely by accident. I happened to be flicking through a magazine, bored, when I flipped past the answers page to the puzzles in that issue. Having not seen the puzzles, I entertained myself trying to reverse-engineer the rules from the solutions given. Needless to say, none of my ideas were even close, but one of my interpretations ended up being worthy of further exploration. I drew out a random board and tried to solve it. Surprisingly, it worked very well, and I've kept solving them every so often until this day.

### The Rules

It’s easiest to understand the rules if you look at a solved board and work backwards. Here’s an example of a typical board:
