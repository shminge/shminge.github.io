I've always been fascinated by puzzles such as **sudoku** and **hashi** (bridges). Sometimes, you get a really beautiful chain of deductions leading to an unexpected 'a-ha!' moment. Those moments, in my opinion, are the reason to solve puzzles in the first place. 

For quite a while, I'd been trying to create my own entry into the genre, but somehow this puzzle came to me completely by accident. I happened to be flicking through a magazine, bored, when I flipped past the answers page to the puzzles in that issue. Having not seen the puzzles, I entertained myself trying to reverse-engineer the rules from the solutions given. Needless to say, none of my ideas were even close, but one of my interpretations ended up being worthy of further exploration. I drew out a random board and tried to solve it. Surprisingly, it worked very well, and I've kept solving them every so often until this day.

### The Rules
*You can try the puzzle yourself [here](https://shminge.github.io/kzp/).*

It’s easiest to understand the rules if you look at a solved board and work backwards. Here’s an example of a typical board:

You can see that in the solved board, every square is either coloured black or white. Here’s the core rule: **the number in any given square counts how many of its neighbours (including diagonalsand the numbered square itself) are of one particular colour.**
For example, the 1 in the top right corner is asserting that out of its three neighbours and itself, there is one square of one colour (in this case black), and therefore three (four neighbours - 1) of the other colour (white). The three right beneath it states that out of its six neighbours (including itself), three are black, and the other three are white. 

The important thing to note here is that two different squares can be ‘counting’ different colours. There is no correlation between what a square is counting and what colour it actually is.

Finally, you may have noticed how the solution colours (red and blue) do not match up with the paint colours. This is because it's actually impossible to tell which is which from the numbers alone. You can still determine the regions, however. As long as your solution has a consistent map between the red/blue numbers and the black/white paints, it's a solution. In other words, if one red square is painted black, all the other red squares must be painted black too.
