Here's a fun little problem to think about.

Let's define a function $f$. It takes in a number $n$, and splits it into the odd digits (the 1st, 3rd, etc) and the even digits (the 2nd, 4th, etc), and then concatenates them. Note that the first digit of our number $n$ is also the first digit of this mixed up number. Take this new rearranged number, and add 1. That value is $f(n)$.

Some Examples:
- $f(75321) = 73153$
- $f(1415) = 1146$
- $f(191) = 120$
- $f(10) = 11$
- $f(7) = 8$

Now, let's consider the sequence $a_{n} = f(a_{n-1})$, with $a_{0}$ some arbitrary choice. For a given choice of $a_{0}$, does $\{a_{n}\}$ loop or grow forever?
